# SATELLITE IMAGE SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION
This project is a part of a Kaggle cometition in Deep Learning course at CentraleSupelec and is carried out with my team member i.e. Vanshika Sharma
## Project description
The task was to employ deep learning to segment and classify the objects in the image. The dataset comprises 374 satellite images (3x3000x4000) of residential neighborhoods in Houston after the hurricane Harvey. 299 out of the total images have corresponding masks for training deep learning. The masks for 75 remaining images are required to submit to the competition. The evaluation metric is dice score. A snapshot of the the image and provided mask is as followed:
